# Our Project

This project is an extension of a named project [TheMazeOfWaze](https://github.com/NetanelShimoni/TheMazeOfWaze.git) , Talked about graphs and all kinds of calculations on different graphs.
This project connects to a particular server that the server provides us with various graphs with a certain amount of robots and fruit, When each time you can choose a game between [0,23], that is 23 different graphs.
So all fruits should be eaten with the help of the robots.
In our code that aims to direct the robots to the fruits as quickly as possible.
To do this, there are two options to choose from: automatic or manual. With the automatic option, robots go alone and try to collect as much fruit as possible
